Welcome to my repository!

This repository will aid me in my practice to master shell and git, in order to accomplish it I've
decided to work on multiple projects, each of which will help me practice a different area of shell 
so that my knowledge may grow.

This commit [21/07/2019] will mark the end of my first project with shell and git after learning
about it just a few hours prior to starting it.

I believe that if you look at the script through its many changes throught the commits, you will
see that my skills have indeed improved quite a lot and my code is now much more readable and
user friendly.

I believe that my commit naming skills have improved yet are still lacking and require more
practice, but that will not be a problem considering the many more projects to come.

Current Known Projects:

	Project-Auto-Backup -> This project has been my first one and had gone many changes while I've
						   been trying to decide what to do in it.

						   At its current state, the project holds a script which when called will
						   backup all the files and directories of the directory the script was
						   called from into a new folder inside a configurable path inside config.

						   In other words a backup script to save data in case of it being lost,
						   corrupted or accidently changed.
